# oddOccurrencesOfZeroes

# You are given an array of non-negative integers a. Your task is to calculate how many elements of a have an odd number of occurrences of the digit 0.

# For example, for [4, 50, 100, 65, 2000, 700, 1, 10], the answer should be 3. These numbers are 50, 2000, and 10.

# Example:

# - For a = [20, 11, 10, 10070, 7], the output should be oddOccurrencesOfZeroes(a) = 3.
#     - In a[1] = 11 and a[4] = 7 the digit 0 does not occur, so these elements do not count (since zero is an even number).
#     - In a[0] = 20 and a[2] = 10 the digit 0 occurs one time (which is an odd number), so these elements do count.
#     - In a[3] = 10070 the digit 0 occurs three times (which is an odd number), so this element counts.
